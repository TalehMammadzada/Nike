                <h1>Just Do It</h1>
                <p>The Air Force is a range of athletic shoes made by Nike that began with the Air Force 1[1] and went
                    on to include the Air Force 2, Air Force 3, Air Force STS, Air Force 5, Air Force XXV and Air Force
                    09. The Air Force 1 was created by designer Bruce Kilgore[2] and was the first basketball shoe to
                    use the Nike Air technology.[3] The shoe is offered in low, mid and high-top styles.<br>The shoes
                    are sold in 5 different styles, low, mid, superlow, high and super high. The mid comes with a
                    connected strap. The high-top Air Force 1s come with a velcro strap; the mid-top strap is secured to
                    the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe
                    comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also
                    referred to as "white on white"), the second most common being solid black ("black on
                    black").[4]<br>Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion
                    secured to the bottom of the laces but with holes on both sides so it can be removed by sliding it
                    off the shoe lace.[5] The medallion is engraved with the inscription "AF-1", with the year "'82"
                    inscribed beside it, and has historically been made out of a silver-colored metal (perhaps pewter).
                    Its original design was more circular, but after a redesign the Air Force 1's 25th anniversary in
                    2007 the medallion is now rectangular. (The redesign also involved encasing the inscription in white
                    plastic; that was discarded in favor of the original medallion material.)
